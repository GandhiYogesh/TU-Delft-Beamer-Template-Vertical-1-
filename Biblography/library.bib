abstract = {This paper presents a novel topology description model for topology optimization problems with embedded movable holes, combining the ability of the level set model for accurate geometrical description of the prescribed hole shapes, and the high efficiency of the material density-based method. By this means, any arbitrary hole shapes can be represented accurately and smoothly, while the topological changes can be easily handled by the material distribution model. An explicit mathematical expression is defined to obtain the actual structural layout by combing both models. Moreover, an effective model for the non-overlap constraint is proposed in a unified and systematic manner to avoid the overlaps between the holes and between each hole and the design domain boundary. Therein, the non-overlap constraint for all the embedded holes is imposed as a single explicit integral constraint over the design domain, thus avoiding the difficulties in the overlap detection of multiple arbitrary-shaped geometries. Such a non-overlap constraint is accurate and differentiable, facilitating an analytical design sensitivity analysis. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the present method. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose a fully coupled multiscale strategy for components made from short fiber reinforced composites, where each Gauss point of the macroscopic finite element model is equipped with a deep material network (DMN) which covers the different fiber orientation states varying within the component. These DMNs need to be identified by linear elastic precomputations on representative volume elements, and serve as high-fidelity surrogates for full-field simulations on microstructures with inelastic constituents. We discuss how to extend direct DMNs to account for varying fiber orientation, and propose a simplified sampling strategy which significantly speeds up the training process. To enable concurrent multiscale simulations, evaluating the DMNs efficiently is crucial. We discuss dedicated techniques for exploiting sparsity and high-performance linear algebra modules, and demonstrate the power of the proposed approach on an injection molded quadcopter frame as a benchmark component. Indeed, the DMN is capable of accelerating two-scale simulations significantly, providing possible speed-ups of several magnitudes.},

abstract = {This paper presents a topology optimization method for structures made of multiple composite components (substructures) with tailored material orientations. It is capable of simultaneously optimizing the overall topology, component partitioning, and material orientation for each component, via a vector field variable that specifies fractional membership to each component, together with the conventional density and orientation variables. The convergence towards the non-fractional, zero/one membership during optimization is achieved by a hypercube-to-simplex projection of the membership variables with a penalization scheme. Through the integration with a continuous material orientation design method, the proposed method is capable of generating multi-component composite structures with tailored material orientations for each component, without a prescribed set of alternative discrete angles. The new method extends the existing continuous material orientation design methods by introducing the concept of components (substructures) with the component-level orientation control, which is suitable for economical production with the conventional high-volume composite manufacturing processes.},

The interpolation of the material properties at the junction of multiple bars ensures that, out of the materials of the intersecting bars, the optimizer chooses the single best material.

abstract = {We present a Matlab implementation of topology optimization for compliance minimization on unstructured polygonal finite element meshes that efficiently accommodates many materials and many volume constraints. Leveraging the modular structure of the educational code, PolyTop, we extend it to the multi-material version, PolyMat, with only a few modifications. First, a design variable for each candidate material is defined in each finite element. Next, we couple a Discrete Material Optimization interpolation with the existing penalization and introduce a new parameter such that we can employ continuation and smoothly transition from a convex problem without any penalization to a non-convex problem in which material mixing and intermediate densities are penalized. Mixing that remains due to the density filter operation is eliminated via continuation on the filter radius. To accommodate flexibility in the volume constraint definition, the constraint function is modified to compute multiple volume constraints and the design variable update is modified in accordance with the Zhang-Paulino-Ramos Jr. (ZPR) update scheme, which updates the design variables associated with each constraint independently. The formulation allows for volume constraints controlling any subset of the design variables, i.e., they can be defined globally or locally for any subset of the candidate materials. Borrowing ideas for mesh generation on complex domains from PolyMesher, we determine which design variables are associated with each local constraint of arbitrary geometry. A number of examples are presented to demonstrate the many material capability, the flexibility of the volume constraint definition, the ease with which we can accommodate passive regions, and how we may use local constraints to break symmetries or achieve graded geometries.},

abstract = {We use topological derivatives to obtain fiber-reinforced structural designs with non-periodic continuous fibers optimally arranged in specific patterns. The distribution of anisotropic fiber material within isotropic matrix material is determined for given volume fractions of void and material as well as fiber and matrix simultaneously, for maximum stiffness. In this three-phase material distribution approach, we generate a Pareto surface of stiffness and two volume fractions by adjusting the level-set plane in the topological sensitivity field. For this, we utilize topological derivatives for interchanging (i) isotropic material and void; (ii) fiber material and void; and (iii) isotropic and fiber materials, during iterative optimization. While the isotropic topological derivative is well known, the latter two required modification of the anisotropic topological derivative. Furthermore, we used the polar form of the topological derivative to determine the optimal orientation of the fiber at every point. Thus, in the discretized finite element model, we get element-wise optimal fiber orientation in the portions where fiber is present. Using these discrete sets of orientations, we extract continuous fibers as streamlines of the vector field. We show that continuous fibers are aligned with the principal stress directions as first reported by Pedersen. Three categories of examples are presented: (i) embedding fiber everywhere in the isotropic matrix without voids; (ii) selectively embedding fiber for a given volume fraction of the fiber without voids; and (iii) including voids for given volume fractions of fiber and matrix materials. We also present an example with multiple load cases. Additionally, in view of practical implementation of laying up or 3D-printing of fibers within the matrix material, we simplify the dense arrangement of fibers by evenly spacing them while retaining their specific patterns.},

As one of the most conceptual and prospective structural optimization design methods, topology optimization intends to seek the optimal layout of materials in an allowed design region under a given load and boundary conditions. Thus, the object of study in the article is the method of topological optimization of aircraft structures. The goal of this article is to analyze the existing approaches, algorithms, as well as application of the method of topological optimization in the aerospace field in applied problems. The tasks are to describe the existing various approaches methods, features, and research directions of topological optimization as well as to study the possibility of application in the manufacturing process of composite structures. The following results were obtained. The optimization methods are briefly explained and compared, and the advantages and limitations of each approach are discussed. The various ways of simultaneous optimization of fiber orientation and structural topology were described and analyzed. The features of different methods of continuous fiber orientation optimization method were reviewed. The discrete fiber orientation optimization methods were represented. The possibility of multi-scale concurrent topological optimization was described. The combination of topology optimization and additive manufacturing was considered. Finally, the topology optimization of FRC structures which have been resolved in literature are reviewed and the potential research fields requiring more investigation are pointed out. Conclusions. In the article, a comprehensive review of the topology optimization design of FRC structures was presented. The promising way is to combine topology optimization with additive manufacturing techniques. However, these proposed methods may not suitable for other more complex problems, such as bucking stability and natural frequency. Hence, the topology optimization design of complex FRC components under complicated conditions is the main challenge in the future. This can be a new trend in the topology design of FRC structures.},

abstract = {Recent advances in level-set-based shape and topology optimization rely on free-form implicit representations to support boundary deformations and topological changes. In practice, a continuum structure is usually designed to meet parametric shape optimization, which is formulated directly in terms of meaningful geometric design variables, but usually does not support free-form boundary and topological changes. In order to solve the disadvantage of traditional step-type structural optimization, a unified optimization method which can fulfill the structural topology, shape, and sizing optimization at the same time is presented. The unified structural optimization model is described by a parameterized level set function that applies compactly supported radial basis functions (CS-RBFs) with favorable smoothness and accuracy for interpolation. The expansion coefficients of the interpolation function are treated as the design variables, which reflect the structural performance impacts of the topology, shape, and geometric constraints. Accordingly, the original topological shape optimization problem under geometric constraint is fully transformed into a simple parameter optimization problem; in other words, the optimization contains the expansion coefficients of the interpolation function in terms of limited design variables. This parameterization transforms the difficult shape and topology optimization problems with geometric constraints into a relatively straightforward parameterized problem to which many gradient-based optimization techniques can be applied. More specifically, the extended finite element method (XFEM) is adopted to improve the accuracy of boundary resolution. At last, combined with the optimality criteria method, several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability and potential of the presented method. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Purpose - Structural performance of additively manufactured parts is deposition path-dependent because of the induced material anisotropy. Hence, this paper aims to contribute a novel idea of concurrently performing the deposition path planning and the structural topology optimization for additively manufactured parts. Design/methodology/approach - The concurrent process is performed under a unified level set framework that: the deposition paths are calculated by extracting the iso-value level set contours, and the induced anisotropic material properties are accounted for by the level set topology optimization algorithm. In addition, the fixed-geometry deposition path optimization problem is studied. It is challenging because updating the zero-value level set contour cannot effectively achieve the global orientation control. To fix this problem, a level set-based multi-step method is proposed, and it is proved to be effective. Findings - The proposed concurrent design method has been successfully applied to designing additively manufactured parts. The majority of the planned deposition paths well match the principle stress direction, which, to the largest extent, enhances the structural performance. For the fixed geometry problems, fast and smooth convergences have been observed. Originality/value - The concurrent deposition path planning and structural topology optimization method is, for the first time, developed and effectively implemented. The fixed-geometry deposition path optimization problem is solved through a novel level set-based multi-step method.},

abstract = {Both the distribution and orientation of anisotropic materials have great effects on the performance of civil and mechanical structures. Taking the maximum structural stiffness as the design objective, a concurrent method for determining the optimal distribution and orientation of orthotropic materials is proposed in this article. The method for determining material orientation theoretically overcomes the ‘repeated global minimum' phenomenon, which often occurs in strain-based and stress-based methods, when the material is shear ‘strong'. Then, the concurrent optimization methodology for material distribution and orientation is developed by introducing an independent discrete topology variable and continuous material orientation angle. The optimized designs of material distribution and orientation are obtained concurrently by the gradient-based bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization method and the proposed material orientation optimization method. Numerical two- and three-dimensional examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed concurrent optimization algorithm.},

abstract = {This paper presents a continuous relaxation of our previous work on the multi-component topology optimization, which enables the use of efficient gradient-based optimization to attain the simultaneous optimization of a base structural topology and its decomposition. In addition to the fictitious material density used in the classic SIMP method, new design variables specifying fractional membership to each component are introduced, in order to relax the process of decomposing a candidate structural topology into a discrete number of components. The concept of joint stiffness is also relaxed using the new component membership variables. Considering stamped sheet metal assemblies jointed by the resistance spot-welding, the stamping die cost consists of die-set material cost and die machining cost. The former is modeled as the minimum bounding box area enclosing each component, approximated by a product of weighted variances in major and minor directions obtained by a weighted principal component analysis. The latter is modeled as an empirical shape complexity index similar to the one available in the literature. Examples on compliance minimization of multi-component sheet metal assemblies are presented, where the proposed continuous relaxation formulation solved by a gradient-based optimization algorithm generated comparable results with dramatically improved computational efficiency over our previous results by discrete formulations solved by the genetic algorithm.},

@article{Arora2005,
abstract = {Alternative formulations for optimization and simulation of structural and mechanical systems and other related fields are reviewed. The material is divided roughly into two parts. Part 1 focuses on the developments in structural and mechanical systems, including configuration and topology optimization. Here the formulations are classified into three broad categories: (i) the conventional formulation where only the structural design variables are treated as optimization variables, (ii) simultaneous analysis and design (SAND) formulations where design and some of the state variables are treated as optimization variables, and (iii) a displacement-based two-phase approach where the displacements are treated as unknowns in the outer loop and the design variables as the unknowns in the inner loop. Part 2 covers more general formulations that are applicable to diverse fields, such as economics, optimal control, multidisciplinary problems and other engineering disciplines. In these fields, SAND-type formulations have been called mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), and partial differential equations (PDE)-constrained optimization problems. These formulations are viewed as generalizations of the SAND formulations developed in the structural optimization field. Based on the review, it is concluded that the basic ideas of the formulations presented in diverse fields can be integrated to conduct further research and develop alternative formulations and solution procedures for practical engineering applications.

@article{Norato2015,
abstract = {This article describes a method for the continuum-based topology optimization of structures made of discrete elements. In particular, we examine the optimization of linearly elastic planar structures made of bars of fixed width and semicircular ends. The design space for the optimization consists of the endpoint locations of the bar's medial axes and their out-of-plane thicknesses. To circumvent re-meshing upon design changes, we project the design onto a fixed analysis grid using a differentiable geometry projection that results in a density field indicating the fraction of solid material anywhere in the design space, as in density-based topology optimization methods. The out-of-plane thickness is penalized so that the optimizer is capable of removing bars during the optimization. The differentiability of the projection allows for the computation via the chain rule of design sensitivities of responses of interest, and therefore it allows for the use of robust and efficient gradient-based optimization methods. Notably, this approach makes it easier to fabricate optimal designs by using off-the-shelf stock material. Furthermore, the method considers the case where bars overlap at their joints (i.e. their thicknesses are added at the joint) and when they do not. Finally, our proposed method naturally accommodates the imposition of several fixed length scales. We demonstrate the proposed approach on classical problems of compliance-based topology optimization and identify its benefits as well as research directions to be addressed in the future.},

A new chapter on depth sensing indentation has been added, and the contents of the other chapters have been completely overhauled with added figures, formulae and explanations. The author begins with an introduction to the mechanical properties of materials, general fracture mechanics and the fracture of brittle solids. This is followed by a detailed description of indentation stress fields for both elastic and elastic-plastic contact. The discussion then turns to the formation of Hertzian cone cracks in brittle materials, subsurface damage in ductile materials, and the meaning of hardness. The author concludes with an overview of practical methods of indentation.},

abstract = {Fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) structure design by topology optimization has become a hot spot in recent years. Nevertheless, the existing researches reveal several unfavorable issues including the fiber dis-continuity, the length scale separation, the decreased design freedom, as well as the complicated fiber orientation optimization. Thus, this paper proposes a full-scale fiber-reinforced structure topology optimization method that is capable of simultaneous design for the structural topology, continuous fiber path, and its morphology (i.e., fiber volume, spacing and thickness). The method builds upon a bi-material element-wise density-based topology optimization framework, where the matrix material and fiber material are considered in a uniform finite element model without the scale separation. Furthermore, a novel fiber generation scheme is developed, in which the bi-material constraint method is introduced by combining the total solid (composite) volume constraint and local fiber proportion constraint, so as to drive the evolution of the general topology, continuous fiber path and fiber morphology, respectively. In this way, it can avoid the above existing issues of the current FRC designs. The fiber-reinforced structures can be naturally generated with continuous fiber paths. Several numerical examples for compliance minimization problems are provided to show the merits of the full-scale optimization method for fiber-reinforced structures. The interpretation design procedure and post-processing error simulation analysis are also presented to further validate the applicability of the proposed method.},

abstract = {We use topological derivatives to obtain fiber-reinforced structural designs with non-periodic continuous fibers optimally arranged in specific patterns. The distribution of anisotropic fiber material within isotropic matrix material is determined for given volume fractions of void and material as well as fiber and matrix simultaneously, for maximum stiffness. In this three-phase material distribution approach, we generate a Pareto surface of stiffness and two volume fractions by adjusting the level-set plane in the topological sensitivity field. For this, we utilize topological derivatives for interchanging (i) isotropic material and void; (ii) fiber material and void; and (iii) isotropic and fiber materials, during iterative optimization. While the isotropic topological derivative is well known, the latter two required modification of the anisotropic topological derivative. Furthermore, we used the polar form of the topological derivative to determine the optimal orientation of the fiber at every point. Thus, in the discretized finite element model, we get element-wise optimal fiber orientation in the portions where fiber is present. Using these discrete sets of orientations, we extract continuous fibers as streamlines of the vector field. We show that continuous fibers are aligned with the principal stress directions as first reported by Pedersen. Three categories of examples are presented: (i) embedding fiber everywhere in the isotropic matrix without voids; (ii) selectively embedding fiber for a given volume fraction of the fiber without voids; and (iii) including voids for given volume fractions of fiber and matrix materials. We also present an example with multiple load cases. Additionally, in view of practical implementation of laying up or 3D-printing of fibers within the matrix material, we simplify the dense arrangement of fibers by evenly spacing them while retaining their specific patterns.},

abstract = {The paper introduces an approach to stress-constrained topology optimization through Heaviside projection–based constraint aggregation. The aggregation is calculated by integrating Heaviside projected local stresses over the design domain, and then, it is normalized over the total material volume. Effectively, the normalized integral measures the volume fraction of the material that has violated the stress constraint. Hence, with the Heaviside aggregated constraint, we can remove the stress failed material from the final design by constraining the integral to a threshold value near zero. An adaptive strategy is developed to select the threshold value for ensuring that the optimized design is conservative. By adding a stress penalty factor to the integrand, the Heaviside aggregated constraint can further penalize high stresses and becomes more stable and less sensitive to the selection of the threshold value. Our two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical experiments demonstrate that the single Heaviside aggregated stress constraint can efficiently control the local stress level. Compared with the traditional approaches based on the Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser and p-norm aggregations, the Heaviside aggregation–based single constraint can substantially reduce computational cost on sensitivity analysis. These advantages make it possible to apply the proposed approach to large-scale stress-constrained problems.},

abstract = {An approach for designing compliant mechanisms with glass fiber-reinforced epoxy materials is presented to obtain the optimum fiber orientation and topology structure simultaneously in this paper. Four-node hybrid stress elements and nodal design variables are adopted to suppress the islands and checkerboard phenomenon without additive filter technology and constraint. Taking fiber orientation and relative density as design variables, minimizing the weighted linear combination of the mutual strain energy and the strain energy is considered as objective function to achieve the desired deformation and enough load-carrying capacity of compliant mechanisms with the volume constraint. The displacement field of structure is obtained by the finite element analysis, and the non-linear optimization problem is solved via the well-known method of moving asymptotes. The numerical examples of designing compliant inverters and grippers with different weighted factors are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {This paper describes a numerical method to optimize elastic bodies featuring a locally periodic microscopic pattern. A new idea, of optimizing the periodicity cell itself, is considered. In previously published works, the authors have found that optimizing the shape and topology of the model hole gives a limited exibility to the microstructure for adapting to the macroscopic loads. In the present study the periodicity cell varies during the optimization process, thus allowing the microstructure to adapt freely to the given loads. Our approach makes the link between the microscopic level and the macroscopic one. Two-dimensional linearly elastic bodies are considered, however the same techniques can be applied to three-dimensional bodies. Homogenization theory is used to describe the macroscopic (eective) elastic properties of the body. Numerical examples are presented, in which a cantilever is optimized for dierent load cases, one of them being multi-load. The problem is numerically heavy, since the optimization of the macroscopic problem is performed by optimizing in simultaneous hundreds or even thousands of periodic structures, each one using its own nite element mesh on the periodicity cell. Parallel computation is used in order to alleviate the computational burden.},

Examples include fully coupled multiphysics problems in thermo-elasticity, fluid-structure interaction, Micro-Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) design and large-scale three dimensional problems. The only feasible way to obtain a solution within a reasonable amount of time is to use parallel computations in order to speed up the solution process. The focus of this article is on a fully parallel topology optimization framework implemented in C++, with emphasis on utilizing well tested and simple to implement linear solvers and optimization algorithms. However, to ensure generality, the code is developed to be easily extendable in terms of physical models as well as in terms of solution methods, without compromising the parallel scalability. The widely used Method of Moving Asymptotes optimization algorithm is parallelized and included as a fundamental part of the code. The capabilities of the presented approaches are demonstrated on topology optimization of a Stokes flow problem with target outflow constraints as well as the minimum compliance problem with a volume constraint from linear elasticity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@article{Wein2020,
abstract = {In this review we identify a new category of methods for implementing and solving structural optimization problems that has emerged over the last 20 years, which we propose to call feature-mapping methods. The two defining aspects of these methods are that the design is parameterized by a high-level geometric description and that features are mapped onto a non-body-fitted mesh for analysis. One motivation for using these methods is to gain better control over the geometry to, for example, facilitate imposing direct constraints on geometric features, while avoiding issues with re-meshing. The review starts by providing some key definitions and then examines the ingredients that these methods use to map geometric features onto a fixed mesh. One of these ingredients corresponds to the mechanism for mapping the geometry of a single feature onto a fixed analysis grid, from which an ersatz material or an immersed-boundary approach is used for the analysis. For the former case, which we refer to as the pseudo-density approach, a test problem is formulated to investigate aspects of the material interpolation, boundary smoothing, and numerical integration. We also review other ingredients of feature-mapping techniques, including approaches for combining features (which are required to perform topology optimization) and methods for imposing a minimum separation distance among features. A literature review of feature-mapping methods is provided for shape optimization, combined feature/free-form optimization, and topology optimization. Finally, we discuss potential future research directions for feature-mapping methods.},

Rather, it improves the Lagrange multipliers and design variables such that the optimality criteria are satisfied upon convergence. The main advantages of the proposed method are its capability of handling multiple constraints and computational efficiency.

In addition to extra strength, fibers have also been used in 4D printing to control and manipulate the change of shape or swelling after 3D printing, right out of the printing bed. Although AM of fiber/polymer composites are increasingly developing and under intense attention, there are some issues needed to be addressed including void formation, poor adhesion of fibers and matrix, blockage due to filler inclusion, increased curing time, modelling, simulation, etc. Nonetheless, numerous innovative techniques were spotted amongst recent work trying to overcome these challenges with new material or manufacturing techniques.},

The 2D and 3D Matlab codes in the paper are developed, using the 88-line 2D SIMP code (Struct Multidisc Optim 43(1): 1–16, 2011) and the 169-line 3D topology optimization code (Struct Multidisc Optim 50(6): 1175–1196, 2014), respectively. This paper mainly contributes to the following four aspects: (1) the code architecture for the topology optimization of cellular composite structures (ConTop2D.m and ConTop3D.m), (2) the code to compute the 3D iso-parametric element stiffness matrix (elementMatVec3D.m), (3) the EBHM to predict the macroscopic effective properties of 2D and 3D material microstructures (EBHM2D.m and EBHM3D.m), and (4) the code to calculate the sensitivities of the objective function with respect to the design variables at two scales. Several numerical examples are tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Matlab codes, which are attached in the Appendix, also offering an entry point for new comers in designing cellular composites using topology optimization.},

abstract = {This study develops a topology optimization approach for design of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminated components with different failure criteria to reduce the risk of structural failure. The discrete material and thickness optimization (DMTO) method is adopted to parameterize the design variables of thickness and orientation of CFRP composites, which is driven by the Method of Moving Asymptote (MMA) algorithm. A large number of local constraints associated with the failure criteria are aggregated in terms of a p-norm function. Analytical sensitivities are derived with respect to the design variables. In this study, a battery hanging structure in electrical vehicle (EV) is exemplified; and a DMTO based design is prototyped and validated through the in-house experimental tests first. To prevent different failure modes, the Hashin, Hoffman and Tsai-Wu failure criteria are then imposed as the design constraints together with manufacturing requirements in the optimization. A comparative study is performed for the design with and without such failure criteria. The results demonstrate that the maximum failure index of the optimized structure with the Tsai-Wu failure criterion decreases the most by 40%; and follows by the Hashin and Hoffman criteria by 24% and 33%, respectively. Finally, the CFRP structure is also optimized to design a so-called double-double laminates for demonstrating the generality of the proposed method. The study is anticipated to gain in-depth understanding of how the failure criteria would affect the design of fiber reinforced composite structures to ensure structural integrity.},

abstract = {This work introduces an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) strategy for the topology optimization of structures made of discrete geometric components using the geometry projection method. Practical structures made of geometric shapes such as bars and plates typically exhibit low volume fractions with respect to the volume of the design region they occupy. To maintain an accurate analysis and to ensure well-defined sensitivities in the geometry projection, it is required that the element size is smaller than the smallest dimension of each component. For low-volume-fraction structures, this leads to finite element meshes with very large numbers of elements. To improve the efficiency of the analysis and optimization, we propose a strategy to adaptively refine the mesh and reduce the number of elements by having a finer mesh on the geometric components, and a coarser mesh away from them. The refinement indicator stems very naturally from the geometry projection and is thus straightforward to implement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AMR method by performing topology optimization for the design of minimum-compliance and stress-constrained structures made of bars and plates.},

abstract = {Design of multiscale structures is a challenging task due to a vast design space of both materials and structures. Consideration of load uncertainty adds another level of complexity. In this paper, a robust concurrent TO (topology optimization) approach is developed for designing multiscale structures composed of multiple porous materials under random field loading uncertainty. To determine the optimal distribution of the porous materials at the macro/structural scale, our key idea is to employ the discrete material optimization method to interpolate the material properties for multiple porous materials. In addition, for the first time we interpret the interpolation schemes in the existing concurrent TO model of porous material with a clear physical meaning by putting forward a SIMP-like single interpolation scheme. This scheme integrates the SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) at the microscale and PAMP (Porous Anisotropic Material with Penalization) at the macroscale into a single equation. Efficient uncertainty characterization and propagation methods based on K-L expansion and linear superposition are introduced, and several important improvements in objective function evaluation and sensitivity analysis are presented. Improved sensitivity analysis equations are derived for volume preserving filtering, which is employed to deal with numerical instabilities at the macro and micro scales in the robust concurrent TO model. Measures to ensure manufacturability and to improve analysis accuracy and efficiency are devised. 2D and 3D examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in simultaneously obtaining robust optimal macro structural topology and material microstructural topologies.},

The numerical instability, which always leads to a non-manufacturing result in topology optimization, is analyzed, along with current methods to control it. To eliminate the numerical instability of topology results, a convolution integral factor method is introduced.

abstract = {The paper proposes a mixed strain- and stress-based topology optimization method for designing the ideal geometry of carbon fibers in composite laminates subjected to either applied tractions or prescribed displacements. On the basis of standard micromechanical approaches, analytical elastic solutions for a single cell, assumed to be a Representative Volume Element (RVE), are ad hoc constructed by involving anisotropy induced by fiber orientation and volume fraction, also taking into account inter-laminar stresses and strains. The analytical solutions are then implemented in a Finite Element (FE) custom-made topology optimization-based procedure rewritten to have as output the best curves the reinforcing fibers have to draw in any composite laminate layer to maximize the overall panel stiffness or to minimize the elastic energy. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, different structures undergoing either in-plane or out-plane boundary conditions have been selected and theoretically investigated, determining the optimal fibers' maps and showing the related results in comparison to standard sequences of alternate fibers disposition for the same composites. Two optimized panels were at the end actually produced using an innovative Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) machine and consolidating the materials by means of autoclave curing processes, in this way replicating the fiber paths obtained from theoretical outcomes. As a control, two corresponding composite structures were also built without employing the fiber optimization strategy. The panels have been tested in laboratory and the theoretical results have been compared with the experimental findings, showing a very good agreement with our predictions and confirming the capability of the proposed algorithm in suggesting the arrangement of the fibers to obtain enhanced mechanical performances. It is felt that the hybrid analytical-FE topology optimization strategy, in conjunction with the possibilities offered by AFP devices, could pave the way for a new generation of ultra-lightweight composites for aerospace, automotive and many industrial applications.},

By this means, any arbitrary hole shapes can be represented accurately and smoothly, while the topological changes can be easily handled by the material distribution model. An explicit mathematical expression is defined to obtain the actual structural layout by combing both models. Moreover, an effective model for the non-overlap constraint is proposed in a unified and systematic manner to avoid the overlaps between the holes and between each hole and the design domain boundary. Therein, the non-overlap constraint for all the embedded holes is imposed as a single explicit integral constraint over the design domain, thus avoiding the difficulties in the overlap detection of multiple arbitrary-shaped geometries. Such a non-overlap constraint is accurate and differentiable, facilitating an analytical design sensitivity analysis.

abstract = {This thesis investigates new optimization methods for structural topology optimization problems. The aim of topology optimization is finding the optimal design of a structure. The physical problem is modelled as a nonlinear optimization problem. This powerful tool was initially developed for mechanical problems, but has rapidly extended to many other disciplines, such as fluid dynamics and biomechanical problems. However, the novelty and improvements of optimization methods has been very limited. It is, indeed, necessary to develop of new optimization methods to improve the final designs, and at the same time, reduce the number of function evaluations. Nonlinear optimization methods, such as sequential quadratic programming and interior point solvers, have almost not been embraced by the topology optimization community. Thus, this work is focused on the introduction of this kind of second-order solvers to drive the field forward. The first part of the thesis introduces, for the first time, an extensive benchmarking study of different optimization methods in structural topology optimization. This comparison uses a large test set of instance problems and three different structural topology optimization problems. The thesis additionally investigates, based on the continuation approach, an alternative formulation of the problem to reduce the chances of ending in local minima, and at the same time, decrease the number of iterations. The last part is focused on special purpose methods for the classical minimum compliance problem. Two of the state-of-the-art optimization algorithms are investigated and implemented for this structural topology optimization problem. A Sequential Quadratic Programming (TopSQP) and an interior point method (TopIP) are developed exploiting the specific mathematical structure of the problem. In both solvers, information of the exact Hessian is considered. A robust iterative method is implemented to efficiently solve large-scale linear systems. Both TopSQP and TopIP have successful results in terms of convergence, number of iterations, and objective function values. Thanks to the use of the iterative method implemented, TopIP is able to solve large-scale problems with more than three millions degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {Fiber reinforced materials are used in assorted engineering application and for this reason, new additive manufacturing technologies have been developed for this type of materials. With these technologies, it is possible to construct composite structures with different shapes and desired fiber orientation. Therefore, reinforced composite structures can be designed based on an optimized fiber orientation. Because of it, several works propose different methods to tailor fiber directions. Albeit, the determination of fiber optimized orientation is a problem usually subjected to multiple local minima issues, unless discrete material optimization methods are used. In addition, in these works, usually a linear relation between stress and strain is considered, which limits simulations to small displacements, strains and rotations. Recently, a method named SPIMFO has been developed where the angle is considered a continuous variable and the local minima issues are circumvented. Thus, this work proposes to determine the optimized fiber orientation of a fiber reinforced composite structure by using the SPIMFO method with a constitutive equation in fully nonlinear range based on transversely isotropic neo-Hookean model. A new method to measure the fiber continuity named index of average continuity is proposed and implemented. The results obtained by using the proposed method are compared to results obtained by using a discrete model named NDFO-m, which is proposed in a previous work.},

abstract = {This article provides a comprehensive review of structural optimization employing topology methods for structures under vibration problems. Topology optimization allows creative and radical design modifications, compared to shape and size optimization techniques. Various works of structural topology optimization, which are subjected to vibration as the response function of the optimization process, are reviewed. Different types of calculus and numerical methods commonly used for solving structural topological optimization problems are briefly discussed. Moreover, different aspects of topology optimization related to vibration problems are explained. The articles reviewed are largely confined to linear systems that concern small vibration amplitudes. Accordingly, the works related to vibration topological optimization are classified according to the method employed (homogenization, evolutionary structural optimization, solid isotropic material with penalization, or level set). The reviewed works are tabulated according to their methodology, year, and the objective functions and applications of each work. Although the homogenization and evolutionary methods were common in the past, the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method is the most popular method applied in recent years. The advantages of the level set method show promise for future applications.},

abstract = {Mechanical properties of parts produced with polymer deposition additive manufacturing (AM) depend on the print bead direction, particularly when short carbon-fiber reinforcement is added to the polymer feedstock. This offers a unique opportunity in the design of these structures since the AM print path can potentially be defined in a direction that takes advantage of the enhanced stiffness gained in the bead and, therefore, fiber direction. This paper presents a topology optimization approach for continuous fiber angle optimization (CFAO), which computes the best layout and orientation of fiber reinforcement for AM structures. Statically loaded structures are designed for minimum compliance where the adjoint variable method is used to compute design derivatives, and a sensitivity filter is employed to reduce the checkerboard effect. The nature of the layer-by-layer approach in AM is given special consideration in the algorithm presented. Examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the method in both two and three dimensions. The solution to our two dimensional problem is then printed with a fused filament fabrication (FFF) desktop printer using the material distribution results and a simple infill method which approximates the optimal fiber angle results using a contour-parallel deposition strategy. Mechanical stiffness testing of the printed parts shows improved results as compared to structures designed without accounting for the direction of the composite structure. Results show that the mechanical properties of the final FFF carbon fiber/polymer composite printed parts are greatly influenced by the print direction, and optimized material orientation tends to align with the imposed force direction to minimize the compliance.},

Carbon fiber filled polymer deposited in beads with the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process, for example, has been shown to have a highly anisotropic material response. This thesis considers the anisotropic behavior of FFF structures and presents a three dimensional topology optimization method that computes the best anisotropic material distribution and direction for minimum compliance of statically loaded AM structure. The optimization method is applied to single loaded problem, multiple loaded problem, and structures with regions of prescribed solid or void. Results show that printing the structures in different planes yields different minimum compliance, and that the lowest overall compliance is achieved when the applied load vector is parallel to the plane of material orientation. Furthermore, the preferred material orientation generally follows the outer contour of the dense material region for each layer.},

abstract = {Laminated piezocomposite actuators (LAPA) are structures composed of piezoelectric and non-piezoelectric materials layers. Due to several parameters and the multiphysics domain involved in the design of LAPA, simple forms are commonly found in industrial applications. However, its design can be systematized by using the topology optimization method (TOM) that permits the solution of complex problems. The design of LAPA with TOM has traditionally considered the optimization of piezoelectric materials over an isotropic substrate, yet some previous researches suggest that LAPA including fiber-reinforced composite layers can increase the performance of these transducers. In addition, works dealing with fiber-based composite focus on static or harmonic analysis with sinusoidal excitations, although other signal inputs are used in practice. In fact, the design of fiber-based LAPA in transient regime has not been assessed before. Thus, a methodology is proposed here to design LAPA with TOM. The actuator is electrically excited with a combined waveform: a sine wave treated as a harmonic problem and a step excitation addressed as a transient problem. Both waves have the same frequency, however they are not applied at the same time. This approach allows the development of a multi-entry actuator since it generates the same level of output displacement independently of the type of excitation input. Consequently, the optimization problem is formulated with the purpose of distributing the material in all layers, the polarization sign in piezoelectric layers and the fiber orientation angle in composite layers, in which the objective function simultaneously seeks for the maximization of the vibration amplitude at certain points of the actuator and its response speed. Eight-node shell elements taking into account the piezoelectric effects are used in the finite element method (FEM) and the “layer wise theory is adopted to model the laminated structure. The Generalized-$\alpha$ method is used to solve the transient problem. In order to optimize the material distribution and the polarization sign, the classical SIMP and PEMAP-P models are used respectively, while to optimize the fiber orientation angles in the composite material, a novel self-penalizable interpolation model is proposed. This optimization problem is solved by using the sequential linear programming (SLP) technique with the CVX solver and the sensitivity analysis is performed with the adjoint method. Discrete signal processing concepts are applied to solve the adjoint problem involving specific points of curves obtained by time integration methods in transient analysis. Numerical techniques are implemented to avoid TOM instabilities. Finally, the potential of this approach is demonstrated with two numerical examples.},

abstract = {The merits and limitations of the Optimality Criteria (OC) method for the minimum weight design of structures subjected to multiple load conditions under stress, displacement and frequency constraints were investigated by examining several numerical examples. The examples were solved utilizing the OC design code that was developed for this purpose at the NASA Lewis Research Center. This OC code incorporates OC methods available in the literature with generalizations for stress constraints, fully utilized design concepts, and hybrid methods that combine both techniques. It includes multiple choices for Lagrange multiplier and design variable update methods, design strategies for several constraint types, variable linking, displacement and integrated force method analysers, and analytical and numerical sensitivities. On the basis of the examples solved, the optimality criteria for general application were found to be satisfactory for problems with few active constraints or with small numbers of design variables. However, the OC method without stress constraints converged to optimum even for large structural systems. For problems with large numbers of behaviour constraints and design variables, the method appears to follow a subset of active constraints that can result in a heavier design. The computational efficiency of OC methods appears to be similar to some mathematical programming techniques. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract = {Topology optimization is a tool for finding a domain in which material is placed that optimizes a certain objective function subject to constraints. This thesis considers topology optimization for structural mechanics problems, where the underlying PDE is derived from linear elasticity. There are two main approaches for solving topology optimization: Solid Isotropic Material with Penalisation (SIMP) and Evolutionary Structural Optimization (ESO). SIMP is a continuous relaxation of the problem solved using a mathematical program- ming technique and so inherits the convergence properties of the optimization method. By contrast, ESO is based on engineering heuristics and has no proof of optimality. This thesis considers the formulation of the SIMP method as a mathematical op- timization problem. Including the linear elasticity state equations is considered and found to be substantially less reliable and less efficient than excluding them from the formulation and solving the state equations separately. The convergence of the SIMP method under a regularising filter is investigated and shown to impede convergence. A robust criterion to stop filtering is proposed and demonstrated to work well in high- resolution problems (O(106)). The ESO method is investigated to fully explain its non-monotonic convergence behaviour. Through a series of analytic examples, the steps taken by the ESO algorithm are shown to differ arbitrarily from a linear approximation. It is this difference between the linear approximation and the actual value taken which causes ESO to occasionally take non-descent steps. A mesh refinement technique has been introduced with the sole intention of reducing the ESO step size and thereby ensuring descent of the algorithm. This is shown to work on numerous examples. Extending the classical topology optimization problem to included a global buckling constraint is considered. This poses multiple computational challenges, including the introduction of numerically driven spurious localised buckling modes and ill-defined gradients in the case of non-simple eigenvalues. To counter such issues that arise in a continuous relaxation approach, a method for solving the problem that enforces the binary constraints is proposed. The method is designed specifically to reduce the number of derivative calculations made, which is by far the most computationally expensive step in optimization involving buckling. This method is tested on multiple problems and shown to work on problems of size O(10^5).},

abstract = {An improved stress-based topology optimization method for laminated composites is proposed by applying the layerwise theory in this research. The layerwise theory is an analysis technique for laminated composites or fiber-reinforced composites that has been developed to overcome the disadvantages of the classical laminated plate theory (CLPT). Because transverse shear deformation is ignored in the CLPT, it cannot be used for thick plates or multiple-layered composites. Therefore, new methods have been developed for analyzing them, and one of them is the layerwise theory. Using the layerwise theory, it is possible to accurately analyze a thick plate and predict the behavior of multiple layers of composites. In the layerwise theory, because a new displacement field and a modified finite element (FE) model are used, the FE model of the stress-based topology optimization method (STOM) is reconstructed to apply the layerwise theory. To apply the STOM for composite materials, the specific failure criterion developed for anisotropic materials must be selected. Therefore, the Tsai–Hill criterion and Tsai–Wu criterion are adapted to the STOM formula to consider the failure of composite materials. Further, the orientation of each layer in a composite significantly affects the optimization result as well as stiffness. Therefore, in this study, we optimize the density and orientation simultaneously by setting the orientation as a design variable. Finally, several types of p-norm approaches are proposed, and one of them can be chosen depending on the location of the maximum value of the constraint.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a topology optimization method that is capable of simultaneous design for structural topology, stiff material (i.e. fiber) layout, and its orientations in functionally graded anisotropic composite structures. Functionally graded composites are inhomogeneous materials with continuously varying spatial composition. The spatial variation in material properties might enable better performance than an isotropic multi-material structure or fiber-reinforced composite structure with fixed fiber volume fraction. In order to enable the simultaneous design of composite topology, spatially varying fiber material layout and orientation, a homogenization design method (HDM) is applied together with a solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method taking into account the advantage of each method. The SIMP method is efficient in determining discrete material states while avoiding intermediate states. Thus, it is applied to determine whether a material is void or a composite state. The HDM allows intermediate material states because it considers true anisotropic composite materials. Taking this advantage, the HDM method is applied to optimize spatially varying anisotropic fiber material layout and orientation. The optimization result of the fiber material is visualized using the projection method proposed for periodic composite structures. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, numerical examples for compliance minimization problems are provided.},

abstract = {Since tremendous resources are consumed in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, the sustainability and efficiency in this field have received increasing concern in the past few decades. With the advent and development of computational tools and information technologies, structural optimization based on mathematical computation has become one of the most commonly used methods for the sustainable and efficient design in the field of civil engineer-ing. However, despite the wide attention of researchers, there has not been a critical review of the recent research progresses on structural optimization yet. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to comprehensively review the previous research on structural optimization, provide a thorough analysis on the optimization objectives and their temporal and spatial trends, optimization process, and summarize the current research limitations and recommendations of future work. The paper first introduces the significance of sustainability and efficiency in the AEC industry as well as the background of this review work. Then, relevant articles are retrieved and selected, followed by a statistical analysis of the selected articles. Thereafter, the selected articles are analyzed regarding the optimization objectives and their temporal and spatial trends. The four major steps in the structural optimization process, including structural analysis and modelling, formulation of optimization problems, optimization techniques, and computational tools and design platforms, are also re-viewed and discussed in detail based on the collected articles. Finally, research gaps of the current works and potential directions of future works are proposed. This paper critically reviews the achievements and limitations of the current research on structural optimization, which provide guidelines for future research on structural optimization in the field of civil engineering.},

abstract = {This paper presents a topology optimization method for structures made of multiple composite components (substructures) with tailored material orientations. It is capable of simultaneously optimizing the overall topology, component partitioning, and material orientation for each component, via a vector field variable that specifies fractional membership to each component, together with the conventional density and orientation variables. The convergence towards the non-fractional, zero/one membership during optimization is achieved by a hypercube-to-simplex projection of the membership variables with a penalization scheme. Through the integration with a continuous material orientation design method, the proposed method is capable of generating multi-component composite structures with tailored material orientations for each component, without a prescribed set of alternative discrete angles. The new method extends the existing continuous material orientation design methods by introducing the concept of components (substructures) with the component-level orientation control, which is suitable for economical production with the conventional high-volume composite manufacturing processes.},

Due to anisotropic mechanical properties of continuous fibers, the paving direction of the fibers determines the mechanical strengths of the printed CFRPs. In this paper, a novel load-dependent path planning (LPP) method has been proposed to generate printing path for CFRPs, which exactly follows the load transmission path of the parts and could provide higher mechanical properties. A topology optimization method is applied to simplify the original disordered load distribution. In the developed Stress Vector Tracing (SVT) algorithm, the printing paths are generated along the load transmission path with the variable spacing of adjacent paths. The LPP method has been compared with the state-of-the-art printing path planning method for continuous fibers and shown better load-bearing and printability.},

The necessary conditions show that an optimal design is characterized by three zones: Zone 1 of pure weak Material 1; Zone 2 of pure strong Material 2; and Zone 3, where Material 1 and Material 2 mix to form an optimal microstructure. To characterize these zones, we introduce two rotationally invariant norms N1 and N2 of a stress tensor. The derived optimality conditions state that the inequality N1 ($\sigma$) < constant1 holds in Zone 1; the inequality N 2($\sigma$) > constant2 holds in Zone 2; and two equalities hold simultaneously in Zone 3: N11 ($\sigma$) = constant1, in Material 1 ; N2($\sigma$) = constant 2 in Material 2. Using this result, we analyze suboptimal projects and find how close the fields are to the regions of optimality.},

By this means, any arbitrary hole shapes can be represented accurately and smoothly, while the topological changes can be easily handled by the material distribution model. An explicit mathematical expression is defined to obtain the actual structural layout by combing both models. Moreover, an effective model for the non-overlap constraint is proposed in a unified and systematic manner to avoid the overlaps between the holes and between each hole and the design domain boundary. Therein, the non-overlap constraint for all the embedded holes is imposed as a single explicit integral constraint over the design domain, thus avoiding the difficulties in the overlap detection of multiple arbitrary-shaped geometries. Such a non-overlap constraint is accurate and differentiable, facilitating an analytical design sensitivity analysis. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the present method. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

However, strong coupling among the composition, microstructure, porous topology, and fabrication of such materials impedes conventional trial-and-error experimental development. In this work, a discontinuous carbon fiber reinforced polymer matrix composite was adopted for structural design. A reliable and robust design approach for developing lightweight multifunctional lattice structural composites was proposed, inspired by biomimetics and based on topology optimization. Three-dimensional periodic lattice blocks were initially designed, inspired by the cuttlefish bone microstructure. The topologies of the three-dimensional periodic blocks were further optimized by computer modeling, and the mechanical properties of the topology optimized lightweight lattice structures were characterized by computer modeling. The lattice structures with optimal performance were identified.},

abstract = {The level set and density methods for topology optimization are often perceived as two very different approaches. This has to some extent led to two competing research directions working in parallel with only little overlap and knowledge exchange. In this paper, we conjecture that this is a misconception and that the overlap and similarities are far greater than the differences. To verify this claim, we employ, without significant modifications, many of the base ingredients from the density method to construct a crisp interface level set optimization approach using a simple cut element method. That is, we use the same design field representation, the same projection filters, the same optimizer, and the same so-called robust approach as used in density-based optimization for length scale control. The only noticeable difference lies in the finite element and sensitivity analysis, here based on a cut element method, which provides an accurate tool to model arbitrary, crisp interfaces on a structured mesh based on the thresholding of a level set—or density—field. The presented work includes a heuristic hole generation scheme and we demonstrate the design approach on several numerical examples covering compliance minimization and a compliant force inverter. Finally, we provide our MATLAB code, downloadable from www.topopt.dtu.dk, to facilitate further extension of the proposed method to, e.g., multiphysics problems.},

Yet, in spite of the increasing use of topology optimization (TO) within product development, specific TO methods for transversely isotropic materials like FRP are scarce in research and even more scarce in practical application. This is amongst other reasons caused by the challenge of simultaneous optimization of mutually dependent material distribution and fiber orientations, which poses an obstacle to established gradient-based optimization routines in terms of iterations (run time) and gradient formulation. Thus, based on bionic methods, an efficient, empirical optimization method is proposed to enable fast and FRP-suitable geometry propositions. Case studies show efficiency and effectiveness: the new approach offers very fast convergence; plus perceptible stiffness gains compared to established topology optimization for isotropic materials.},

abstract = {We present a new method for the simultaneous topology optimization and material selection of structures made by the union of discrete geometric components, where each component is made of one of multiple available materials. Our approach is based on the geometry projection method, whereby an analytical description of the geometric components is smoothly mapped onto a density field on a fixed analysis grid. In addition to the parameters that dictate the dimensions, position, and orientation of the component, a size variable per available material is ascribed to each component. A size variable value of unity indicates that the component is made of the corresponding material. Moreover, all size variables can be zero, signifying the component is entirely removed from the design. We penalize intermediate values of the size variables via an aggregate constraint in the optimization. We also introduce a mutual material exclusion constraint that ensures that at most one material has a unity size variable in each geometric component. In addition to these constraints, we propose a novel aggregation scheme to perform the union of geometric components with dissimilar materials. These ingredients facilitate treatment of the multi-material case. Our formulation can be readily extended to any number of materials. We demonstrate our method with several numerical examples.},

abstract = {Microstructures with spatially-varying properties such as trabecular bone are widely seen in nature. These functionally graded materials possess smoothly changing microstructural topologies that enable excellent micro and macroscale performance. The fabrication of such microstructural materials is now enabled by additive manufacturing (AM). A challenging aspect in the computational design of such materials is ensuring compatibility between adjacent microstructures. Existing works address this problem by ensuring geometric connectivity between adjacent microstructural unit cells. In this paper, we aim to find the optimal connectivity between topology optimized microstructures. Recognizing the fact that the optimality of connectivity can be evaluated by the resulting physical properties of the assemblies, we propose to consider the assembly of adjacent cells together with the optimization of individual cells. In particular, our method simultaneously optimizes the physical properties of the individual cells as well as those of neighbouring pairs, to ensure material connectivity and smoothly varying physical properties. We demonstrate the application of our method in the design of functionally graded materials for implant design (including an implant prototype made by AM), and in the multiscale optimization of structures.},

abstract = {This work presents a topology optimization method for design of architected truss lattices made of anisotropic struts. Employing anisotropic materials for the lattice struts can result in better effective properties than those that can be obtained for a lattice in which each strut is made of a single isotropic material, but different struts may be made of different materials. This work focuses on lattice struts that are either hollow or fiber-reinforced, which effectively result in transverse isotropy. The proposed method simultaneously optimizes the spatial configuration of the struts and the volume fraction of the reinforcing fibers or the holes in each strut to extremize the lattice effective properties. A parametric description of the lattice struts is projected onto a density field for analysis via the geometry projection technique. The proposed method accommodates any number of specified material symmetries by performing appropriate reflections of the projected density with respect to the symmetry planes. To ensure the size variables converge to 0 or 1, we employ an explicit penalization by imposing a discreteness constraint. To improve manufacturability, a no-cut constraint is imposed to ensure that struts are not partially cut upon reflection by the symmetry planes or by the faces of the unit cell. The smallest angle at which two struts can intersect is also constrained to avoid overlaps that are difficult to manufacture. Examples of maximization of the effective bulk modulus and minimization of the effective Poisson's ratio of the lattice demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this work we focus on continuum-based structural topology optimization and more specifically on geometric feature based approaches, also known as explicit topology optimization, in which a design is described as the assembly of simple geometric components that can change position, size and orientation in the considered design space. We first review various recent developments in explicit topology optimization. We then describe in details three of the reviewed frameworks, which are the Geometry Projection method, the Moving Morphable Components with Esartz material method and Moving Node Approach. Our main contribution then resides in the proposal of a theoretical framework, called Generalized Geometry Projection, aimed at unifying into a single formulation these three existing approaches. While analyzing the features of the proposed framework we also provide a review of smooth approximations of the maximum operator for the assembly of geometric features. In this context we propose a saturation strategy in order to solve common difficulties encountered by all reviewed approaches. We also explore the limits of our proposed strategy in terms of both simulation accuracy and optimization performance on some numerical benchmark examples. This leads us to recommendations for our proposed approach in order to attenuate common discretization induced effects that can alter optimization convergence.},

abstract = {Cellular structures consist of foams, honeycombs, and lattices. Lattices have many outstanding properties over foams and honeycombs, such as lightweight, high strength, absorbing energy, and reducing vibration, which has been extensively studied and concerned. Because of excellent properties, lattice structures have been widely used in aviation, bio-engineering, automation, and other industrial fields. In particular, the application of additive manufacturing (AM) technology used for fabricating lattice structures has pushed the development of designing lattice structures to a new stage and made a breakthrough progress. By searching a large number of research literature, the primary work of this paper reviews the lattice structures. First, based on the introductions about lattices of literature, the definition and classification of lattice structures are concluded. Lattice structures are divided into two general categories in this paper: uniform and non-uniform. Second, the performance and application of lattice structures are introduced in detail. In addition, the fabricating methods of lattice structures, i.e., traditional processing and additive manufacturing, are evaluated. Third, for uniform lattice structures, the main concern during design is to develop highly functional unit cells, which in this paper is summarized as three different methods, i.e., geometric unit cell based, mathematical algorithm generated, and topology optimization. Forth, non-uniform lattice structures are reviewed from two aspects of gradient and topology optimization. These methods include Voronoi-tessellation, size gradient method (SGM), size matching and scaling (SMS), and homogenization, optimization, and construction (HOC). Finally, the future development of lattice structures is prospected from different aspects.},

abstract = {In recent years, the field of additive manufacturing (AM), often referred to as 3D printing, has seen tremendous growth and radically changed the means by which we describe valid 3D models for production. In particular, it is now conceivable to produce composite structures consisting of smoothly varying oriented anisotropic constitutive materials. In the present work, we propose a sensitivity driven method for the generation of transverse isotropic fiber reinforced structures having smooth spatially varying orientations. Our approach builds upon finite element analysis (FEA) and density-based topology optimization (TO). The local material orientations are formulated as design variables in a stiffness maximization problem, and solved with a non-convex gradient-based optimization scheme. Length-scale control is achieved through the use of filters for regularization. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to handle large-scale 3D problems with synchronous optimization of material densities and orientations yielding millions of design variables on multiple load case scenarios. The method is shown to be compatible with compliant mechanism optimization as well as local volume constraints. Finally, the approach is extended with an additional design variable dictating the ratio of anisotropy for each element, thereby delegating the choice of material type to the optimization scheme.},

This review article is based on a unified formulation and covers in detail both exact, analytical methods and approximate, discretized methods of layout optimization. Although discretized solutions are unavoidable for most practical, real-world problems, only explicit analytical solutions provide (i) a reliable means for checking the validity and convergence of numerical methods and (ii) a basis for assessing the relative economy of other designs. Moreover, some of the most efficient new numerical methods of layout optimization are iterative versions of analytical methods.

It is capable of simultaneously optimizing the overall topology, component partitioning, and material orientation for each component, via a vector field variable that specifies fractional membership to each component, together with the conventional density and orientation variables. The convergence towards the non-fractional, zero/one membership during optimization is achieved by a hypercube-to-simplex projection of the membership variables with a penalization scheme. Through the integration with a continuous material orientation design method, the proposed method is capable of generating multi-component composite structures with tailored material orientations for each component, without a prescribed set of alternative discrete angles. The new method extends the existing continuous material orientation design methods by introducing the concept of components (substructures) with the component-level orientation control, which is suitable for economical production with the conventional high-volume composite manufacturing processes.},

abstract = {Topology optimization is a numerical design tool used to generate structural concepts that present optimal load paths for a given set of functional requirements. This functional generative design capability has been used to lightweight high performance structures with 1D, 2D and 3D stress states. On the other hand, fiber-reinforced composites are the perfect candidate material to use in high performance structures due to the tailorability of their stiffness and strength properties. Although numerical tools that simultaneously tailor the composite material properties while optimizing the structural topology exist, these tools are inherently limited to 1D and 2D stress states. This work aims to address this limitation by presenting a new topology optimization framework for 3D design of fiber-reinforced composites. Such computational design framework is composed of three key elements: (i) a macromechanical model, called multi-thread theory, that estimates the stiffness properties of 3D fiber reinforced composites; (ii) a stable coupling algorithm between macro-mechanics and structural analysis codes; and (iii) a scalable optimization algorithm. To evaluate the feasibility of this framework, 2D and 3D topology optimization results are presented. The 2D numerical results are used to investigate the benefits of the new continuation scheme formulated within the optimization algorithm. Moreover, by optimizing 3D topologies with geometric conditions such that the stress state is approximately plane stress, the 2D results are used to show consistency between this computational design framework and other 2D approaches based on classical laminate theory. Finally, to demonstrate the capability of this framework a 3D MBB-beam is simultaneously optimized for both topology and fiber reinforcement orientation. Thisproblem optimized 249,452 design variables to yield an optimized MBB 3D-beam that is 75% lighter, yet only 16.5% more flexible. Such step-change improvement in performance was due to the complex geometry of the optimized MBB 3D-beam (and its aligned reinforcement) involving structural elements such as curvilinear arches, variable-thickness sidewalls and uni-axial struts connecting these walls.},

@article{Otomori2015,
abstract = {This paper presents a simple Matlab implementation for a level set-based topology optimization method in which the level set function is updated using a reaction diffusion equation, which is different from conventional level set-based approaches (Allaire et al. 2002, 2004; Wang et al. 2003) that use the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to update the level set function. With this method, the geometrical complexity of optimized configurations can be easily controlled by appropriately setting a regularization parameter. We explain the code in detail, and also the derivation of the topological derivative that is used in the level set-based topology optimization. Numerical results for stiffness maximization problems are provided to facilitate the reader's understanding. The presented code is intended for educational purposes only. This paper was inspired by previously published papers presenting Matlab code for a SIMP method (Sigmund 2001; Andreassen et al. 2011), a level set-based method (Challis 2010), and FreeFem ++ code for a structural optimization method (Allaire and Pantz 2006). Readers can investigate results provided by these different methods and discover the prominent aspects of each particular method.

abstract = {Big efforts have been made to optimise the behaviour and the properties of fibre reinforced materials. The fibre-matrix bonding, the influence of the fibre-matrix content and many other relations of several systems have been intensively investigated. Nevertheless, the arrangement of the fibres within a structure was a neglected subject of research. CAIO (computer aided internal optimisation) was developed to predict the optimal arrangement of fibres for given load and boundary conditions. The mechanism of the method has been adapted from biological structures. CAIO is based on the finite elements method (FEM). In a first step the force flow of a structure is calculated by using FEM. The CAIO routine changes orientation of orthotropic axes into the directions of force flow with respect to the FE-results. A following stress analysis leads to a reduced shear stress distribution. The optimum fibre arrangement is calculated by an automatically iterative process of alternating FE-run and CAIO calculation. The latest version of CAIO allows the calculation of the optimum fibre arrangement in three-dimensional shell structures as well as in three-dimensional volume structures.},

@article{Xiao2021,
abstract = {Graded lattice sandwich structures (GLSSs) enable superior structural performances due to the continuously-varying configurations and properties of lattices in space. This paper proposes a design method for GLSSs by multiscale topology optimization. In this method, the geometrical configuration of a prototype lattice cell (PLC) is described by an explicit topology description function (TDF). Based on some sample lattice cells, a Kriging metamodel is constructed to predict the effective property of each lattice cell. Based on the Kriging metamodel, the thickness optimization of two solid face-sheets and the distribution optimization of lattice cells in core layer are respectively implemented. Driven by their equivalent densities, the configurations of lattice cells with similar topological features are generated by interpolating the shape of the PLC. Then, the graded lattice cells (GLCs) are generated. Using the proposed method, the computational burden involved in design of GLSSs can be reduced significantly. What is more, the manufacturability of GLSSs can be guaranteed by constructing a proper PLC with the help of TDF. Numerical examples in terms of compliance and natural frequency optimization of GLSSs are provided to verify the advantages of the proposed method. Also, bending tests are performed on the GLSSs fabricated by additive manufacturing (AM). The results reveal that GLSSs are stiffer and have larger natural frequencies than the uniform lattice sandwich structures.},

@article{Wu2017,
abstract = {This study addresses the design of ply orientation for a CFRP vehicle door by implementing a Discrete Material Optimization (DMO) method in a general-purpose commercial finite element code (ABAQUS) and mathematical analysis tool (MATLAB). To accommodate multiple loading conditions, the weighted mean compliance of the CFRP vehicle door was taken as the objective function, subject to the constraints on the local displacements, primary natural frequency and manufacturability. The sensitivities of objective and constraints were calculated by using the strain vectors, which is a more general method than using element stiffness matrices and allows extracting local displacements from the commercial finite element code. A gradient-based algorithm was employed in the DMO approach to tackle the large-scale problem. In the discrete topology optimization, four material penalization schemes were attempted in this study. The proposed DMO approach was compared with the empirical design and the existing method in commercial software. The results demonstrated that the proposed method is able to produce a more competent solution than the empirical design and other optimization methods efficiently.},

@article{Cheng1992,
abstract = {The paper studies the relation between topology optimization and size optimization of truss structures. The goal of the optimization is to minimize the structural weight under stress constraints and side constraints on member cross sectional areas. The limiting stress concept is defined and the computational formula of limiting stress for truss structures calculated by a finite element method is given. Based on the limiting stress concept the continuity of the stress function at zero cross sectional area is carefully examined which enables us to understand the dilemma of defining the stress function in the closed interval up to zero cross sectional area. By considering the relation between the limiting stress and allowable stress the feasibility of stress constraints is discussed and the difficulty of adding a new bar to the truss or deleting an existing one is better understood. We have also shown that for topology optimization of truss structures the feasible design domain in the design space is a connected domain with possible degenerate subregions as long as upper bounds on cross sectional areas are large enough. To overcome this difficulty we introduce a quality function and replace the stress constraint by a new constraint which has the same feasibility and is continuous in the closed interval up to zero cross sectional area. In this way the formulations of structural topology optimization and size optimization are unified and an optimization algorithm which works only for problems with continuous constraint functions can be applied to optimize the topology of the truss structures. Simple examples are presented to show the possibility of automatically and rationally removing or adding bars and hence treating topological optimization in the same way as sizing optimization. Finally, further possible research on these topics is addressed. {\textcopyright} 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All Rights Reserved.},
